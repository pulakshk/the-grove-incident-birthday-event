    ## Team Superpowers (satire)
    - Startup Investors: Can turn panic into a term sheet and call it conviction. | Irony: They ask for transparency and then request a cleaner version for investors.
- Product Council: Can convert chaos into a roadmap with impossible deadlines. | Irony: They own prioritization but still say "this came unexpectedly."
- Engineering Blackbox: Can explain every failure perfectly, 15 minutes after it already happened. | Irony: They hate vague language but write incident updates no one can parse.
- Ops & Ground Truth: Can keep systems alive while everyone else debates ownership. | Irony: They are told execution is simple by people who never execute anything.
- Culture & Narrative Lab: Can make raw truth sound cinematic enough that people finally listen. | Irony: They spot spin instantly and still accidentally create better spin.

    ## Canonical Conspiracy Chain
    1. Kovid and Anubhav forced a shadow deploy at 7:03 PM to protect launch optics.
2. Harsh had already flagged a P0 auth flaw that leadership deferred.
3. Aniket and Siddak kept treasury moves active through a side-letter loophole.
4. Shubham and Shubh maintained separate internal vs investor performance narratives.
5. Pooja drafted legal suppression and delayed escalation in the critical window.
6. Sajag preserved the board-note diff proving narrative edits after the incident.
7. Bharat found V at 9:14 PM, confirming the delay that changed the outcome.
8. Neil and Sagar assembled and stress-tested the dead-drop to force admissions one year later.

    ## Deepfake Clarity
    Deepfake memo, simple version:
- The voice is synthetic: generated from old founder speech samples.
- The message contains mostly real clues but 1-2 bait details.
- Bait details are there to identify who reacts defensively too fast.
- Host line: "Fake voice, real pressure test."


    ## Core Cast
    Aniket Chandra, Anubhav Gaba, Bharat Dhir, Harsh Bhimrajka, Kovid Poudel, Neil Daftary, Pooja Ghatia, Sagar Badiyani, Sajag Jain, Shubham Jain, Siddak Bakshi

    ## Attendance Rule
    If someone is missing, their captain can activate their packet once in each round. No storyline dependency breaks.

    ## Interaction Rule (non-negotiable)
    Every accusation must include one witness from outside your team, otherwise it is invalid.
