# Interaction Engine v5

Purpose: maximize mingling and prevent passive spectators.

## Interaction Rules
1. Every player must complete at least 2 interactions outside their own team by Round 3.
2. Every team must recruit one non-team witness before board vote.
3. Any player who unlocks contradiction gets to assign one sip.
4. Quiet player priority: host gives first mic to least-spoken player each round.
