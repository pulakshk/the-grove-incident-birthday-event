# Printing Guide - What Must Be Printed?

Short answer: no, you do NOT need to print everything.

## Must Print (minimum)
- 1 copy: host sheet (`game/v5/pdf/host_sheet_v5.pdf`)
- 1 per team: team cards (5 PDFs in `game/v5/pdf/teams/`)
- 1 per active player: character cards (`game/v5/pdf/characters/`)

## Optional Print
- Artifact manifest (`vault/dead-drop-27/artifact_manifest.csv`)
- One-page reveal summary (`game/v5/final_rundown.md`)

## Keep Digital (recommended)
- Full dead-drop zip (`vault/dead-drop-27.zip`)
- Audio memo (`voice-clone-founder.mp3` or `.m4a`)
- Spreadsheet artifacts (`treasury-map-Nov.xlsx`, `ab-test-raw-export.csv`)

Active players in this build: 42
- If any team has fewer than 4 players at 8 PM, apply host rebalance from `host_sheet_v5.md`.
