THE GROVE INCIDENT - CONFIDENTIAL PLAYER BRIEF

Hi Vaibhav, your role is locked.

What you must know before game start:
- Plot: One year after V's death at Grove Labs launch night, an archive appears at the party. It contains deploy logs, treasury trails, and edited board notes. From 8:00 PM, teams investigate in rounds and build a conspiracy chain.
- Your Team: Engineering Blackbox
- Team objective: Prove where shadow deploy, auth risk, and crash intersected.
- Enemy team: Startup Investors
- Team superpower (satire): Can explain every failure perfectly, 15 minutes after it already happened.
- Team irony: They hate vague language but write incident updates no one can parse.

Your character:
- Alias: Deploy Syndicate - Deploy Cartographer
- Public profile: Tech Bro, Cleartrip. Known for being philosophical; carries untapped context from the launch night.
- Corporate superpower: Can ask one question that breaks rehearsed narratives.
- Live mission: Trade one clue only after receiving a signed contradiction.
- Evidence lane: auth-vuln-P0-jira.pdf

Rules before 8 PM:
1) Keep this brief private.
2) Stay in character but keep it fun.
3) Do not accuse anyone before Round 1 starts.

Rules during game:
1) Speak to at least 2 people outside your team.
2) Every accusation needs 1 witness + 1 artifact.
3) If your teammate is missing, your captain can activate their handoff packet.

Logistics:
- Doors 5:00 PM | Game starts 8:00 PM | Twist 8:45 PM | Reveal 9:00 PM | Venue: Grove A7
- BYOB welcome (especially post-8 PM arrivals).
