THE GROVE INCIDENT - CONFIDENTIAL PLAYER BRIEF

Hi Vihan, your role is locked.

What you must know before game start:

- Your Team: Engineering Blackbox
- Team objective: Prove exactly where shadow deploy, auth risk, and crash intersected.
- Enemy team: Startup Investors
- Team superpower (satire): Can explain every failure perfectly, 15 minutes after it already happened.
- Team irony: They hate vague language but write incident updates no one can parse.

Your character:
- Alias: Systems Switcher
- Public profile: Engineering Blackbox. Newly hired systems engineer. Was not aware of the version 3 bug.
- Corporate superpower: Can translate corporate jargon into one honest sentence.
- Live mission: Figure out who triggered the power cycle that killed the oxygen.
- Evidence lane: prod-deploy-log-7:03.txt
