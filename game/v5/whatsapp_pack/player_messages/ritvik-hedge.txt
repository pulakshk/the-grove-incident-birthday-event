- Your Team: Product Council
- Team objective: Build one trusted timeline from conflicting meetings and chat logs.
- Enemy team: Ops & Ground Truth

Your character:
- Alias: Feature Tribunal - Roadmap Custodian
- Public profile: Product Manager, Virgio. Known for being board game enthusiast; carries untapped context from the launch night.
- Corporate superpower: Can predict who will dodge accountability in any room.
- Live mission: Turn one rumor into a verifiable statement with witness name.
- Evidence lane: inboard-notes-v-edit.pdf
