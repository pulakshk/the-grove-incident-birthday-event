Use this as the single source for host script, team cards, and character cards.

## Facts
- Date: Sunday, 1 March 2026
- Main goal: interaction-first murder mystery with social rotation
- Floor setup: parallel vibes, common evidence network
- Removed no-show names from active cast: Naren Kashyap, Aishwarya Manjunath, Sarthak Dwivedi

## Team Superpowers and Ironies
- Startup Investors: Can turn panic into a term sheet and call it conviction. | irony=They ask for transparency and then request a cleaner version for investors. | enemy=Engineering Blackbox
- Product Council: Can convert chaos into a roadmap with impossible deadlines. | irony=They own prioritization but still say "this came unexpectedly." | enemy=Ops & Ground Truth
- Engineering Blackbox: Can explain every failure perfectly, 15 minutes after it already happened. | irony=They hate vague language but write incident updates no one can parse. | enemy=Startup Investors
- Ops & Ground Truth: Can keep systems alive while everyone else debates ownership. | irony=They are told execution is simple by people who never execute anything. | enemy=Product Council
- Culture & Narrative Lab: Can make raw truth sound cinematic enough that people finally listen. | irony=They spot spin instantly and still accidentally create better spin. | enemy=Engineering Blackbox

## Canonical Chain
1. Kovid and Anubhav forced a shadow deploy at 7:03 PM to protect launch optics.
2. Harsh had already flagged a P0 auth flaw that leadership deferred.
3. Aniket and Siddak kept treasury moves active through a side-letter loophole.
4. Shubham and Shubh maintained separate internal vs investor performance narratives.
5. Pooja drafted legal suppression and delayed escalation in the critical window.
6. Sajag preserved the board-note diff proving narrative edits after the incident.
7. Bharat found V at 9:14 PM, confirming the delay that changed the outcome.
8. Neil and Sagar assembled and stress-tested the dead-drop to force admissions one year later.

## Deepfake Memo Explainer
Deepfake memo, simple version:
- The voice is synthetic: generated from old founder speech samples.
- The message contains mostly real clues but 1-2 bait details.
- Bait details are there to identify who reacts defensively too fast.
- Host line: "Fake voice, real pressure test."
