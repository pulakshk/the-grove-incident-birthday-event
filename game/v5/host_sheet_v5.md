    TEAM SATIRE POWERS
    ------------------
    - Startup Investors: Can turn panic into a term sheet and call it conviction.
- Product Council: Can convert chaos into a roadmap with impossible deadlines.
- Engineering Blackbox: Can explain every failure perfectly, 15 minutes after it already happened.
- Ops & Ground Truth: Can keep systems alive while everyone else debates ownership.
- Culture & Narrative Lab: Can make raw truth sound cinematic enough that people finally listen.

    INTERACTION ENFORCER RULES
    --------------------------
    1) No monologues longer than 45 seconds.
    2) Each team must involve at least two non-team players by Round 3.
    3) Any claim without witness + artifact is "theory", not evidence.
    4) Host can call "cross-floor switch" once per round.

    PRE-8PM REBALANCE RULE (IF ATTENDANCE DROPS)
    --------------------------------------------
    1) Any team with fewer than 4 live players gets one floating player from the largest team.
    2) Floating players keep their original character card but temporarily serve the smaller team.
    3) Keep all core characters in original teams; only move flexible/optional players.

    DEEPFAKE EXPLAINER (IF CONFUSED)
    --------------------------------
    Playback tip: use `voice-clone-founder.m4a` first. Keep `voice-clone-founder.mp3` as filename-compatible backup.

    Deepfake memo, simple version:
- The voice is synthetic: generated from old founder speech samples.
- The message contains mostly real clues but 1-2 bait details.
- Bait details are there to identify who reacts defensively too fast.
- Host line: "Fake voice, real pressure test."

    FINAL REVEAL LINES
    ------------------
    - Kovid and Anubhav forced a shadow deploy at 7:03 PM to protect launch optics.
- Harsh had already flagged a P0 auth flaw that leadership deferred.
- Aniket and Siddak kept treasury moves active through a side-letter loophole.
- Shubham and Shubh maintained separate internal vs investor performance narratives.
- Pooja drafted legal suppression and delayed escalation in the critical window.
- Sajag preserved the board-note diff proving narrative edits after the incident.
- Bharat found V at 9:14 PM, confirming the delay that changed the outcome.
- Neil and Sagar assembled and stress-tested the dead-drop to force admissions one year later.

    ATTENDANCE CONTINGENCY
    ----------------------
    Use absentee handoff packets. Missing players never block core reveal.
