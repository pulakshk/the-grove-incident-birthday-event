# Two Hour Runbook (Use This)

## 0) Source of truth
- Script: `/Users/pocketfm/Documents/birthday/game/game_script_v5.md`
- Host sheet: `/Users/pocketfm/Documents/birthday/game/v5/host_sheet_v5.md`
- Final roles: `/Users/pocketfm/Documents/birthday/game/v5/final_rundown.md`

- Team cards PDF folder: `/Users/pocketfm/Documents/birthday/game/v5/pdf/teams/`

## 1) T-120 to T-90 (send DMs)
- Open `/Users/pocketfm/Documents/birthday/game/v5/dm_packets/dm_send_list.csv`
- Send first to `priority_send=yes` guests (24 people)
- Character card files are in `/Users/pocketfm/Documents/birthday/game/v5/dm_packets/priority_cards/`
- Use this DM text from `/Users/pocketfm/Documents/birthday/game/v5/dm_packets/dm_template.txt`

## 2) T-90 to T-60 (print only essentials)
Print:
- `/Users/pocketfm/Documents/birthday/game/v5/pdf/host_sheet_v5.pdf` (1 copy)
- `/Users/pocketfm/Documents/birthday/game/v5/pdf/teams/*.pdf` (5 total)
- Character cards only for confirmed/high guests, rest on phone

## 3) T-60 to T-40 (set up rooms)
- Lower hall: open social + drinks + mingling
- Upper hall: interrogation + timed rounds
- Put one timer where everyone can see
- Keep one marker + notepad per team

## 4) T-40 to T-20 (vault setup)
- Unzip `/Users/pocketfm/Documents/birthday/vault/dead-drop-27.zip`
- Keep folder open on laptop/phone
- At round timings, share artifact files in party WhatsApp group OR cast to TV
- Audio: play `voice-clone-founder.m4a` (prefer), keep `voice-clone-founder.mp3` as backup

## 5) T-20 to T-0 (host prep)
- Read only these in order:
  1. `/Users/pocketfm/Documents/birthday/game/v5/host_sheet_v5.md`
  2. `/Users/pocketfm/Documents/birthday/game/v5/final_rundown.md`
- Pick one co-host to timekeep and enforce 45-second speaking cap

## 6) Live flow
- 5:00 PM doors and free mingle
- 8:00 PM Round 1 starts
- 8:45 PM deepfake twist
- 9:00 PM reveal

## 7) If things get chaotic (fallback)
- Skip Round 3 evidence exchange
- Go directly to board vote + reveal
- Keep only one rule: every accusation must name one witness outside own team

## 8) Must-not-do
- Do not send full conspiracy reveal before 8 PM
- Do not send full vault zip to all players at once before Round 1
- Do not let one team keep all clues
