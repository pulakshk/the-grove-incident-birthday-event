ZERO CONFUSION HOST GUIDE (READ THIS ONLY)

What this is:
- A social murder-mystery style game.
- Objective: force interaction while solving a conspiracy chain.

Your only 4 jobs:
1) Keep time.
2) Move rounds.
3) Reveal the right file at the right time.
4) Stop monologues.

Timeline:
- 5:00 PM doors, free mingle.
- 8:00 PM Round 1 (timeline claims).
- 8:18 PM Round 2 (cross-team challenges).
- 8:36 PM Round 3 (evidence trade).
- 8:45 PM deepfake audio twist.
- 8:52 PM board vote.
- 9:00 PM final reveal.

Round rules (say this every round):
- "One claim = one witness + one artifact."
- "45-second speaking cap."
- "Talk to someone outside your team before next claim."

If chaos happens:
- Skip Round 3.
- Go directly to board vote + reveal.
