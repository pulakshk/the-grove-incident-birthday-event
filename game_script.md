# THE GROVE INCIDENT: SIGNAL & NOISE
## Interactive Mystery Night for Sunday, 1 March 2026

---

# WHAT THIS VERSION CHANGES

1. Core cast is expanded from 6 to all guests marked `Likely to come = High` (24 people).
2. A midgame "kill" event is added in a way that still works even if people drop off.
3. Plot now leans harder into current themes: AI wrappers, model leaks, crypto treasury risk, deepfakes, growth hacks, and security debt.
4. Late arrivals and +1s are explicitly supported with role injection rules.

# THE STORY

One year ago, founder **Vikram "V" Vora** died at a fake launch party for **Grove Labs**. The postmortem was buried, the cap table froze, and everyone moved on publicly.

They did not move on privately.

Tonight at The Grove A7, the original network is back for a "birthday reunion." At 8:00 PM, a leak archive appears in the party WiFi drive:

`/vault/dead-drop-27.zip`

Inside are:
- board notes that do not match investor decks,
- AI prompts that auto-generated fake metrics commentary,
- a crypto treasury wallet map,
- one voice-cloned founder memo.

At 8:32 PM, a second incident happens live: one major witness is "killed" in-game and can no longer speak freely.

The question becomes two-layered:
- What really happened to V last year?
- Who is trying to control the truth tonight?

# FLEX CAST (MEDIUM / +1 / LATE ARRIVAL)

These roles can be injected dynamically:
- The Adjacent Founder
- The Compliance Intern
- The AI Prompt Auditor
- The Token Lawyer
- The Neighbor Witness
- The Last-Minute Plus-One

Each flex role gets:
1. One suspicious observation.
2. One partial clue.
3. One false belief.

This prevents the game from stalling if attendance shifts.

# GAME FLOW (5:00 PM TO 9:00 PM)

## 5:00 to 7:45 PM: Free Party + Warmup
- Floor split is live.
- Guests receive character cards on arrival.
- Optional warmup: "One confession, one lie" in pairs.

## 8:00 PM: BRIEFING (Host reads)

"You all built, sold, or survived Grove Labs.
V died at launch. The company froze. The story was edited.
Tonight the archive is open.
At 9:00 PM we lock one truth in.
Until then, no one is clean."

## ROUND 1 (8:05 to 8:17) - Timeline Build
- Teams reconstruct 7:00 PM to 9:00 PM.
- Every player gives one timestamped claim.
- Team penalty sip if two claims conflict by more than 10 minutes.

## ROUND 2 (8:17 to 8:30) - Cross-Stack Interrogation
- Each team chooses one AI/crypto claim to challenge:
  - "Was the model real?"
  - "Were wallet transfers authorized?"
  - "Was growth organic?"
- 90 seconds per challenge.
- If challenged player dodges 2 direct questions, they drink.

## 8:32 PM - MIDGAME KILL EVENT (Mandatory)

Mechanic:
1. Host draws one `OFFLINE` card from a prepared stack.
2. Card targets one **present** Priority Character (default order below).
3. Target is declared "killed in-game" and becomes a **Ghost Witness**.

Ghost Witness rules:
- Cannot speak full sentences until Round 4.
- Can only respond with `YES / NO / NOT THAT` cards.
- Must hand over one clue immediately.

Default target order (use first present):
1. Siddak Bakshi
2. Neil Daftary
3. Aniket Chandra
4. Shikhar Sharma
5. Kovid Poudel

## ROUND 3 (8:33 to 8:45) - Forensics Sprint
- Teams inspect dropped clue + one clue from another team.
- Build one hypothesis linking AI + finance + motive.
- Must include one technical artifact and one personal motive.

## ROUND 4 (8:45 to 8:55) - Board Vote
Each team submits:
1. Who is responsible for V's original death.
2. Who triggered tonight's midgame kill.
3. Which artifact proves intent.

## 9:00 PM - REVEAL

Canonical reveal for this version:
- **V was murdered by a coordinated chain, not a lone killer.**
- **The chain**:
  1. **Kovid** triggers a shadow deploy to expose V publicly.
  2. **Siddak + Aniket** force a treasury confrontation in the same window.
  3. **Pooja** controls the narrative, delays the emergency response call, and edits evidence trails.
  4. **One supporting witness** (chosen by host from top-voted suspects) silently confirms the cover-up by withholding a critical clue.
- **Legal framing (in-game)**: conspiracy + omission + evidence tampering.
- **Tonight's midgame kill trigger**: staged by the person most threatened by the leak archive (host selects from top 2 vote-getters).

This keeps the ending interactive while preserving a coherent backbone.

# DRINKING CUES (LIGHTWEIGHT)

Global cues:
1. Someone says "pivot" seriously -> everyone sips.
2. Someone says "AI" but cannot explain model input/output -> they sip.
3. Someone says "on-chain" -> nearest two people sip.
4. Someone says "we'll fix post-launch" -> engineering row sips.
5. Someone says "let's take this offline" -> one random person is silenced for 30 seconds.

---

# DROP-OFF + LATE ARRIVAL PROTOCOL (CRITICAL)

## If Priority Characters are absent
- Their clue envelope is reassigned to nearest domain:
  - Crypto missing -> assign to Aniket or Neil.
  - AI/Data missing -> assign to Shubham or Shikhar.
  - Product missing -> assign to Shubh or Devashish.
  - Design/Growth missing -> assign to Aiswarya or Pooja.

## If someone drops midgame
1. Convert them to "Left the Room".
2. Their clue is put in a neutral pool.
3. Host draws one neutral clue into Round 3.

## If +1 arrives late
1. Assign Flex Role immediately (AI Prompt Auditor or Neighbor Witness).
2. Give 60-second onboarding:
   - "You saw one suspicious thing."
   - "You trust one person wrongly."
   - "You hold one half-clue."

Game never pauses for attendance changes.
