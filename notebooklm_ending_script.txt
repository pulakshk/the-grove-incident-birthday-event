**NARRATOR (Hard-hitting true-crime podcast host):**
The investigation is concluded. The encrypted logs have been cracked. The true timeline of what happened at The Grove on March 1st is no longer a secret.

For the past year, you've all pointed fingers. You've blamed each other. But the truth is much darker. This was not a murder by a single lone wolf. This was a cascading failure of human greed, ego, and cowardice across all five factions. 

Here is the undeniable truth of how V died.

**[VISUAL: Timestamp flashes on screen: 18:45 PM]**

**NARRATOR:**
It started with the Product Council. Aanak, Devashish, Gunjan, Kartik, Pooja, Ritvik, Shubh, Swapnil, and Varun had forced an impossible deadline. They knew the product wasn't ready. 

At 18:45 PM, the Operations & Ground Truth team—led by floor marshals like Bharat, Iti, Mammoth, Manasi, Naisargi, Shrenik, and Vrishali—noted severe structural instability in the physical server room holding the new 'Version 3' architecture. 

Simultaneously, the Engineering Blackbox, including Anubhav, Ayush Mittal, Harsh, Kovid, Shikhar, Shubham, Vaibhav, and Vihan, detected a massive, unpatchable memory leak in the core algorithm. The launch was destined to fail catastrophically. The warnings were sent.

**[VISUAL: Timestamp flashes on screen: 18:55 PM]**

**NARRATOR:**
But the warnings were ignored. 

Instead of halting the launch, the Startup Investors—heavy hitters like Akshat, Aniket, Mehul, Neil, Sagar, and Siddak—panicked. They had side-letters. They had liquidity demands. They realized that a delayed launch would destroy the company's valuation before they could cash out. 

The Investors pressured the Product Council, and together, they ordered Engineering to execute a "Shadow Deploy." They forced the engineers, despite their protests, to push an older, stable—but entirely fake—version of the code, disguised as 'Version 3'. 

**[VISUAL: Timestamp flashes on screen: 19:03 PM]**

**NARRATOR:**
At exactly 19:03 PM, the Shadow Deploy went live. The metrics spiked instantly. The launch looked like a massive success. The investors got their valuation, with Sarthak already setting up emergency payouts.

Behind the scenes, the Culture and Media Lab—Story Ops like Adarsh, Aiswarya, Ayush Borse, Mohnish, Pranjal, Rahul, and Shaunak—immediately went to work spinning a fabricated narrative. They built a PR shield, selling the fake success to the press and actively burying the warnings from the floor. 

**[VISUAL: Timestamp flashes on screen: 20:15 PM]**

**NARRATOR:**
But 'V', the founder, wasn't fooled. 

He dug into the logs. He discovered the Shadow Deploy. He realized his legacy was built on fraudulent data demanded by his own investors and covered up by his own media team. 

At 20:15 PM, V locked himself in Server Room 4. He began manually deleting the fake database to expose the fraud to the world. He was going to burn The Grove down.

**[VISUAL: Timestamp flashes on screen: 21:00 PM - The Silent Hour]**

**NARRATOR:**
The panic set in. The Startup Investors and the Product Council realized V was destroying the company. 

But who stopped him? 

It was the Operations Team—the ones who control the building. They deactivated his keycard. They trapped V inside Server Room 4 to prevent him from reaching the press. 

And it was the Engineering Team—terrified of taking the fall for the fake code—who remotely triggered a total server purge to hide their own tracks. That massive data wipe, triggered by Naisargi and Bharat, and observed by Vihan, overloaded the cooling systems in Room 4, sucking the oxygen out of the room. 

Even the unexpected guests—Vishnupriya and Surabhi—witnessed the chaos, and chose to stay silent.

**[VISUAL: The screen cuts to black]**

**NARRATOR:**
Who killed V? 

The Engineers pulled the trigger. Operations locked the door. Product wrote the lie. Culture sold the lie. And the Investors paid for it all. 

None of you are innocent. 
You are all guilty. 

Case Closed.
