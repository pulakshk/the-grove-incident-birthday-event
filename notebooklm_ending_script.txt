**[AUDIO: Ticking clock, tense cinematic drone]**

**NARRATOR (Cold, Analytical):**
The investigation is concluded. 
The encrypted logs have been decrypted. The true timeline of what happened at The Grove on March 1st can now be established as absolute fact.

This was not a murder by a single lone wolf. This was a cascading failure of human greed, ego, and cowardice across all five factions. 

Here is the undeniable truth.

**NARRATOR:**
At 18:45 PM, the Operations & Ground Truth team noted structural instability in the physical server room holding the new 'Version 3' architecture. At the same time, the Engineering Blackbox detected a massive, unpatchable memory leak in the core algorithm. 

The launch was destined to fail catastrophically. The Product Council was informed immediately. 

**[VISUAL: Timestamp flashes on screen: 18:55 PM]**

**NARRATOR:**
Instead of halting the launch, the Product Council and the Startup Investors panicked. The Investors realized that a delayed launch would destroy the company's valuation before they could liquidate their shares. 

Together with Product, they ordered Engineering to execute a "Shadow Deploy." They forced the engineers to push an older, stable—but entirely fake—version of the code, disguised as 'Version 3'. 

**[VISUAL: Timestamp flashes on screen: 19:03 PM]**

**NARRATOR:**
At 19:03 PM, the Shadow Deploy went live. The metrics spiked. The launch looked like a massive success. 

Behind the scenes, the Culture and Media Lab immediately went to work spinning a fabricated narrative, selling the fake success to the press while ignoring the warnings coming from the floor marshals.

**[VISUAL: Timestamp flashes on screen: 20:15 PM]**

**NARRATOR:**
But 'V', the founder, realized what had happened. He discovered the Shadow Deploy. He realized his legacy was built on fraudulent data demanded by his own investors. 

At 20:15 PM, V locked himself in Server Room 4. He began manually deleting the fake database to expose the fraud. 

**[VISUAL: Timestamp flashes on screen: 21:00 PM - The Silent Hour]**

**NARRATOR:**
The Startup Investors and the Product Council realized V was destroying the company. But it was the Operations Team who deactivated his keycard, trapping him inside Server Room 4 to prevent him from reaching the press. 

And it was the Engineering Team who remotely triggered a total server purge to hide their own tracks—an action that overloaded the cooling systems in Room 4 and suffocated the founder. 

**[VISUAL: The screen cuts to black]**

**NARRATOR:**
Who killed V? 

The Engineers pulled the trigger. Operations locked the door. Product wrote the lie. Culture sold the lie. And the Investors paid for it all. 

You are all guilty. 

Case Closed.
